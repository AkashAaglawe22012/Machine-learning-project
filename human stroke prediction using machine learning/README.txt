This project aims to predict the likelihood of stroke in humans using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging a dataset with various health parameters such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status, the project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (utilizing algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The ultimate goal is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of stroke for timely intervention and prevention strategies.
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates and handle missing values in the dataset.
Normalize or standardize numerical features for better model performance.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Data Visualization:

Explore the dataset through visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Visualize the distribution of stroke cases vs. non-stroke cases to identify class imbalances.
Hypothesis Testing:

Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to identify significant differences in features between stroke and non-stroke groups.
Explore correlations between features and stroke incidence using statistical tests like Pearson correlation coefficient.
Feature Selection:

Use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance scores from tree-based models, or dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA) to select relevant features for the prediction model.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Implement various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks for stroke prediction.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train each machine learning model using the training set.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
Final Model Selection:

Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.
Save the trained model for future predictions or deployment in production environments.
Documentation and Reporting:

Document the project steps, code, and results in a clear and organized manner.
Create visualizations and summary tables to communicate findings and insights from the analysis.
Provide interpretations of model predictions and recommendations based on the model's output.
